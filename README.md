## A manuscript for USENIX 2026 review.


#### To run the code without code editing, make sure the following file directory structure:

```
├─dataset // MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, or you can change the root in source code
│  └─Your Datasets
├─workplace
│  └─Federated-Unlearning-Watermark-Attacks-against-Intellectual-Property-Protection
```

#### then:
```
cd Federated-Unlearning-Watermark-Attacks-against-Intellectual-Property-Protection
```

#### and finally:
```
python fed_uw_mnist.py
```

We will simplify the code operation in the following edition.
